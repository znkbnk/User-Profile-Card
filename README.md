# User-Profile-Card

Project Description:
Create a User Profile Card component that 
displays basic information about a user,
such as their name, profile picture,
and a short bio. The profile card
should be reusable and customizable,
allowing you to easily create multiple user profiles.

Step 1:
Set up a new React project using
Create React App or any other preferred method.

Step 2:
Design a basic layout for the
User Profile Card component.
You can use CSS frameworks like
Bootstrap or styled-components for styling.

Step 3:
Create a User Profile Card component
that accepts props for the user's name,
profile picture, and bio.

Step 4:
Display the user's name, profile picture,
and bio in the component.

Step 5:
Style the User Profile Card to make it
visually appealing and user-friendly.

Step 6:
Utilize CSS techniques like flexbox or grid
to organize the profile card layout.

Step 7:
Create multiple instances of the
User Profile Card component, each with
different user information,
to demonstrate reusability.

Step 8:
To use this component, you can import
it into your main application component
and pass the necessary props. Make sure
to replace 'path/to/profile-picture.jpg'
with the actual path to the user's profile picture.
